Screen-Master
=============

An app that helps you manage images on a remote display (e.g. a projector). More detailed description: I am a life-long D&amp;D dungeon master and I recently bought a cheapish ($270) LED projector and hung it from the ceiling, pointed down at the gaming table. When connected to my laptop by HDMI cable, I have instant digital battle mats. However, showing images on the projector's second desktop is a bit of a hassle, so I wrote this program to create two synchronized image display windows so I can quickly change table-top scenes without stopping the game to drag stuff around with the mouse.
